# Simple Memory Game Web

This is just a simple game, that u have had played in your childhood.

This game is simple, and of just one level, in which one have to click on the cards availble on the screen and have to find identical ones, if cards do match then they will automatically be removed from the screen and if two turned cards do not match then they will set themselves back as they were before.

This Game was created/developed by me, as i just wanted to practice my CSS and learn some of the JavaScript so I chose this project to give my time to, as needed the js to make this work out and as a begineer it truly was of so much worth, had learned bundle of new things in JS.

P.S: I have commented almost each and every thing in JS explaining what thing is done for what functionality. So, u guys can go through it, if want to, and this repo is open for PRs.
