# Simple Memory Game Web

This is just a simple game, that u have had played in your childhood.

This game is simple, and of just one level, in which one have to click on the cards availble on the screen and have to find identical ones, incase, if cards do match they will automatically be removed from the screen and if two turned do not match then they will set themselves back as they were before.

This Game was created/developed by me as i just wanted to practice my CSS and learn some of the JavaScript so I chose this project to give my time to and it truly was of so much worth, had learned bundle of new things in JS.

P.S: I have commented almost each every thing in JS explaining what is done for what functionality, so u guys can go through it, if want to, and this repo is open for PRs.
